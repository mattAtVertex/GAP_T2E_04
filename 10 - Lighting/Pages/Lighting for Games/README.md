# Lighting for Games

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lighting, rendering, and presentation account for a major portion of a portfolio pieceâ€™s success. In recent conversations with art directors and hiring managers at game studios, the consensus was the same:</span></p>
<p><strong>Presentation is everything!</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lighting, Rendering and Presentation are the first gatekeeper you have to clear.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Something to always keep in mind:</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad lighting can make a good scene look bad.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good lighting can make a bad scene look good.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great lighting can make a great scene get you the job.</span></li>
</ol>

<h2>The Lighting Workflow</h2>
<p>When lighting a scene, it's important to remember the natural progression:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gathering reference for your Mood Board</li>
<li>Defining your HDRI</li>
<li>Defining your primary Light Source</li>
<li>Painting with Lights</li>
<li>Post Processing</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Gathering Reference</h2>
<p>By this point, you already have a mood board from the planning and visual storytelling phases. While this likely already has reference to help in defining mood, it can help to gather more reference to help with your initial lighting pass. When gathering reference for this purpose, remember that you are focused on the lighting itself and not the content of a scene. You want to gather reference that will allow you to isolate and focus on things like light color, value contrast, and sharpness of shadows.</p>
<p>A good place to start looking would be cinema. Think of a movie that may have had a scene in it that reminds you of the mood and tone you are going for with your scene. References like this can help guide you in how to create the same sense of mood with the lights in your scene.</p>
<p>Look at the film scenes below and take notice of how the lighting of each scene changes the mood and tone. Take note of the colors, the saturation, and the contrast. Notice how these three points change the entire mood. Also take note of the detail in the shadows while not being directly lit in some cases vs the high contrast scenario with direct lighting and darker shadows. How you approach this in your scene will have a major affect on the mood of your scene.</p>

<h2>Things to Remember</h2>
<p>Lighting can be overwhelming, but we can approach it just like we do with the previous phase of environment art. Starting with a plan and a good blockout, you can take it all the way to the end.</p>
<p>Always keep these tips in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Reference</li>
<li>Start with the broad strokes</li>
<li>Less is more</li>
</ul>
